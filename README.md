Here is a draft README for the Sentence Embeddings with NextJS project:

# Sentence Embeddings with NextJS

This project demonstrates generating sentence embeddings using a Transformer model in a Next.js application.

## Overview

The app allows users to input a query sentence and a list of other sentences. It then uses a background Web Worker to generate embeddings for each sentence using the `@xenova/transformers` library and a MiniLM model. 

The query embedding is compared to the other sentence embeddings using cosine similarity to find the most similar sentences.

The results are displayed on the page, ranked by similarity score.

## Running the app

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` 
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Implementation

The app is implemented using:

- Next.js framework (React)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Web Workers for background processing
- `@xenova/transformers` for generating embeddings

The worker script `worker.js` handles loading the model and generating embeddings. It communicates with the main app using message passing.

The main App component manages:

- User input for query/sentences
- Passing input to worker
- Receiving and displaying results
- Loading state
